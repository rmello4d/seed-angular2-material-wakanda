3. Go to the place where you download/unzip your seed-angular2-material-wakanda repository and copy the subfolder angular2-Material to /Documents/Wakanda/wakanda-extension-templates/web (PS> this folder may vary if you have a windows or mac machine, in doubt,  just look for the wakanda-extension-templates/web folder and  copy the angular2-Material folder there)<br>PS.<br> 
MAC: /Documents/Wakanda/wakanda-extension-templates/web<br>
Windows : Wakanda Enterprise\Studio\Extensions\wakanda-extension-templates\web<br>


4. This is all you need to add a new seed to your Wakanda projects, then, when creating your next project, just choose the newly web template 'Angular 2 Material':

5. After creating your project, a complete scafolding is available for you (backend, database, web and mobile folders). For this particular seed, you can just Run the project by clicking 'Run Page':

6. IMPORTANT, when you 'Run Page' for the first time, you have to wait for all libraries to be charged in the npm install (this installation time will vary based on your internet connection, it can take from few seconds to several minutes). Once you have all the libraries downloaded, the Wakanda Studio will automatically load the first page for you and you should see the following:
