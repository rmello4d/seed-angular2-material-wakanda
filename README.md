# seed-angular2-material-wakanda
A fairly complete seed from Wakanda that uses Angular2 and Material, more than 20 widgets available

1. If you don't have yet, download Wakanda at http://www.wakanda.io

2. Clone or download the zip file of [this extension](https://github.com/rmello4d/seed-angular2-material-wakanda) to your computer 

3. Go to the place where you download/unzip your extension and copy the angular2-Material folder to /Documents/Wakanda/wakanda-extension-templates/web (PS> this folder may vary if you have a windows or mac machine, in doubt,  just look for the wakanda-extension-templates/web folder and  copy the angular2-Material folder there)

4. This is all you need to add a new seed to your Wakanda projects, then, when creating your next project, just choose the newly web template 'Angular 2 Material' :
